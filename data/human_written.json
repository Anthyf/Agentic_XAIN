{"credit": {"narrative_list": ["The model predicted that the customer is rather likely to be a good credit risk and will repay the loan without issues. The reason why the model was still not quite certain and which detracted some probability of being a good credit was the absence of a checking account. This could suggest that the customer is not quite involved in their finances or perhaps does not have enough financial inflow to require such an account. However, all other factors pointed in the opposite direction that reduce the risk for the bank. First, the duration of the loan is quite a bit shorter than the average loan. Keep in mind that time plays a big role in credit risk, due to possible events like loss of income, falling sick etc and hence shorter duration is positive for the bank. Next, the customer had a good amount of savings indicated some financial stability and good spending habits. The fact that the customer took the loan for common reasons, or that the \"other\" category for loan purpose was not selected, was a tell for the model to increase good credit probability. It makes sense that taking a loan for reasons that the bank has a lot of experience with makes it less risky from their point of view. To summarize, aside from the absence of a checking account all features point towards either financial stability or reduced risk for the bank, which is why the model predicted a good credit risk.", "The model predicted that the customer was slightly more likely to be a good credit score than not. Most of the features contribute in a negative way and detract from the baseline probability of being a good credit, however their effect is quite minor and overall the credit estimation remains positive. Let's briefly go through them. First, the credit amount is double the average and naturally slightly increases the risk for the bank. Next, the customer has a negative checking account balance. While this by itself does not have to be detrimental and financially literate people also could go negative, it could be suggestive of bad spending habits or overspending. The customer also does not have a savings account, indicating some degree of financial illiteracy if they still keep all their savings in cash. On the other hand, the customer has an excellent credit history always repaying their loans on time without any issues. This suggests a careful and responsible person which of course increases the trust of the bank. To summarize, there are many factors that slightly increase the risk of the bank and reduce the probability of the customer being a good credit. However, since the baseline probability of an average customer being a good credit is quite high, it did not detract to a sufficient degree to change the prediction of the model.", "The model predicted that the customer is quite likely to be a good credit risk. The main contributing positive factor is the fact that the customer requests the loan for a single year, in comparison to the typical duration of these loans which lies closer to two years. This decreases the risk for the bank, since there is less probability for unexpected negative events to occur that could prohibit the customer from payment. However there are also negative points. The customer did not have a checking account. Having a checking account could indicate good financial literacy or a lifestyle that requires an account, often correlated with higher income. The customer was also really young, and far below the average age for the loan, which increases the risk for the bank as young people could have less of a fallback net. Finally, the credit amount is quite low and almost half of what is typically requested, which naturally had a positive contribution and increases the probability that amount can be paid back without much difficulty. To summarize, the picture is mixed with both positive factors that could indicate a financially not very mature person, but at the same time the duration is quite short and the credit amount is low such that it is not likely to form a significant risk. ", "The model predicted that the customer is slightly more likely to be a good credit risk rather than a bad one. The story is an interesting one because all of the most important features have a negative contribution but all relatively minor ones. First of all, the customer is in their early twenties which is quite a bit below the average credit asker that is in their mid thirties. This has a negative contribution because young people generally are more likely to have fewer savings, a less established career, which of course increases the risk for the bank. This is indeed confirmed by the fact that the customer was employed for less than 1 year at their current job, which is not suggestive of good job stability. Their checking account had negative balance, which could indicate bad spending habits. Finally, the last very minor point was the fact that the customer had no savings account and this could suggest financial illiteracy or not a large amount of savings. The story turns out to be really peculiar. All most important features are negative, yet the customer still receives a positive credit score. This can be explained by the fact that far more minor features that were not discussed here still had some positive effect. More importantly,  the baseline probability for a person to be a good credit being quite high and these negative contributions were not sufficient for the model to predict otherwise. ", "The model predicted that the customer will likely be a good credit, but only by a small margin. The most dominant factor was the absence of a checking account and was actually negative, detracting from the probability of being a good creditor. By itself this could be indicative that the customer is either financially not literate, or perhaps does not have sufficient finances to require a checking account. However, the next feature adds some nuance to this hypothesis. The customer has  a savings account with an appreciable amount of money on it, which of course has a positive contribution for several reasons. It counterbalances the previous impression from the checking account, and suggests good financial stability. The customer also requested the loan for a shorter duration far below the average, which is positive and creates less risk for the bank that something in their situation changes in this short period. Finally, the reasons for asking the credit were \"others\" and did not fall into the typical categories for requesting credit. This had a minor negative contribution as getting loans for atypical reasons is by default might seem a bit risky for the bank. In summary, the features create a mixed picture of the customers with some factors pointing ", "The model predicted that the customer is likely to be a bad credit risk and that some issues might come up. This can be easily understood by the fact that the two most important features had a major negative contribution towards the probability of being a good credit. First of all, the most important contribution came from the credit history, where the customer had some previous problems with credit installments. Previous problems with credit can understandably be a warning sign for the bank as they could be indicative of future performance. The next feature that also contributed negatively was the absence of a checking account. This could indicate either insufficient financial knowledge or the absence of any funds to require such an account. There was also a positive contribution since the duration of the credit loan was far smaller than average, only six months. This did slightly counter  the previous negative contributions but not sufficiently to fully outweigh them. The final contribution was a curious one, and the fact that the debtor does not live in a rented property had a negative contribution towards the probability. It could be that this feature is indirectly correlated with owning a house and having other credits, but we cannot be sure. \nTo conclude, the prediction towards bad credit risk was mostly formed by previous bad credit history, with additional more minor negative contributions. The one positive point of having a very short credit duration was insufficient to convince the model otherwise, and could been seen as unconvincing in light of other risky factors. ", "The model predicted that the customer would be a \"good\" credit risk with an extremely high confidence. By far the most important factor in this prediction was the positive impact of their account containing more than 200 DM, indicating an ability to save money. Combined with the positive impact of the third and fourth most important features of employment duration and age. The customer is almost 50 years old and has been employed for more than 7 years, suggesting they are financially stable. The second largest contribution is negative and from the fact that the customer is paying other installments to stores, which could pose a higher financial stress on them. In conclusion the customer was predict as having good credit despite their on going installments to stores because of the high balance of their savings account, their consistent employment and their relatively old age of nearing 50.\n", "The model predicted that the customer would have bad credit with an extremely low confidence, it is almost a 50/50 choice between good and bad. By far the largest contribution to this decision, with almost twice the contribution of any other feature, is the negative contribution from the amount of their loan. The customer requests an amount of over 8500 DM, almost 3x the average loan amount. Such a high loan could be difficult to repay. This is compounded by the third and fourth most important features of installment plans and employment duration respectively. The customer has other installments they must repay to a bank, which will make it more difficult for them to repay the installments for their requested loan. Their employment duration of less than one year also doesn't provide a sense of security, which could lead to further difficulties in repayment. The second most important factor, which is much more impactful than the third and forth features is the status of their checking account of more than 200 DM. In conclusion the customer was predicted as having bad credit because of the high requested amount, other installments owed to banks and their short employment duration, despite the strong status of their checking account.", "The model predicted with high confidence that the customer would be of good credit. This most influential feature to this prediction with duration. The short duration of only 6 months, compared to the average of over 20 positively contributes to the prediction. A shorter loan has fewer repayments and is so is less likely to be defaulted on. Additionally the fourth highest contributing feature, credit history, provides a positive contribution as all previous loans have been paid back in full. This history of repaying loans suggests they are likely to pay back the currently requested loan. However, the purpose of \"other\" is a negative contributing factor, with almost as large an absolute contribution as the duration. Compared to the other purposes such as education or housing, this category may be seen as less of a necessity and thus suggest a less financially conscious customer. The third most important feature is age, where there relatively young age of 28 provides a negative contribution. This is likely due to correlations between age and lower earnings, less employment and residency history. In summary, the customer was predicted as \"good\" credit due to their short duration of loan and spotless credit history, despite their unclear purpose and young age. ", "The model predicts with high confidence that this person is likely to pay back. The most important factor is the status of the checking account. The fact that the person has an above average amount on his checking account is combined with a credit request that is slightly below average. The person is also professionally  in a stable situation. He ha been working at his current employer for a period of time that is above average. His saving behavior is also better than average. As a conclusion we can say that an above average amount of money on checking ans saving account, combined with a stable professional situation and a moderate request for credit results in a prediction of creditworthiness. ", "The model is quite confident about the fact that this person is likely to pay back. The most important reason for this is the amount of money that is in his savings account. This indicates that the person is able to save money and live on less than he makes. However, the amount of credit he asks for is quite high and this influences the decision in a negative way. The status of his checking account is also better than average. The customer will use the money for repairs. It would have been better that the money was used for another investment. It is difficult to know whether the repairs will result in an increase in value that is higher than the amount invested. As a conclusion we can say that the stable financial situation makes that the model is quite confiident about the fact that the person will be able to pay back the large amount of money. ", "The model predicts that this person is not likely to pay back. The fact that he has no checking account is a major red flag. This indicates that the person has an unstable situation in which he is not used to do payments on a regular basis. The purpose of the loan is repairs and that is also not one of the favorite categories. The fact that he his unemployed is also something that does not contribute to the overall impression of being someone that takes responsibility. Another factor that raises questions is the fact that the person does not have a savings account. As a conclusion we can say that having no job and no accounts made the model predict that this person will have problems paying back his loan. ", "The customer is predicted as not a credit risk but the model is not very confident about this. The main reason is the status of the checking account. The customer does not have one, which contributes very negatively to its prediction outcome. The amount of credit requested also contributes negatively to its prediction. The amount is below the average amount requested, but taken into account the other features of the customers, it is still considered as a risky amount.\nThe customer has more savings than the average customer, which contributes positively to its prediction outcome. Lastly, the credit is taken out to buy a new car, which also contributes positively to the prediction outcome. This is likely considered as not a very risky purchase by the bank.\nTo summarize, both the lack of a checking account and the amount request point to a worse credit score, but the customer is still predicted as not being a credit risk due to the amount of money requested and the balance on its saving account.", "The model predicts the customer as not being a credit risk, but with very low confidence. The customer has a history of delayed payments on previous credits and other running installments to the bank that have to be made by this customer which negatively influence the model's prediction. However, these negative features are just outweighed by the positive impact of the status of the checking account (which has a balance of more than 200 DM) and the low duration of the credit. Since the customer has a large sum of money in their checking account and only ask for a credit for a rather short period in time, the model predicts that the customer is not a credit risk even though they do not have the best credit history.", "The model predicts that the customer is a credit risk. The model mostly predicts this because of the large amount of money the customer asks for and the long duration of the credit request. The customer also does not have any savings in their savings account and a negative balance in their checking account. These factors imply that the customer does not have enough monetary knowledge or responsibility to be able to pay back the credit they asked for. The customer asks for a higher than average credit while having a lower than average financial stability, which leads the model to predict the customer as a bad credit.", "The model predicted that the customer will be a good credit risk, meaning that they are unlikely to pose any problems with repayment. The most important feature towards this decision was the fact that the customer had an amount over 200DM on their checking account, indicating that the customer has freely available money which the bank interprets as a positive factor. However, both the amount of credit requested, and the duration of the credit, were two negative contributions that fully counteracted the positive impression from the available money in the checking account. Larger credit amounts and longer credit durations naturally increase the exposure and risk for the bank. Finally, a small negative contribution came from the small amount of savings the customer had. Overall, most of the important features had a negative contribution. However, keeping in mind that in general people repay their credits, to get predicted as a bad credit a sufficient amount of negative factors should be present which was not the case here. ", "The model predicted that the customer is likely to be a bad credit risk and some troubles with repaying their debt might be expected. The most important feature pointing the model towards this negative decision was the fact that the customer had other installment plants to the bank, meaning that this would not be their only credit running. Multiple credits naturally increase the risk for the customer to get into financial difficulty and increases the risk. The next contribution that also reduced the probability of being a good credit, was the fact that the customer had a negative balance on their checking account, suggesting already existing financial difficulties. The purpose for the credit was also in the category \"others\" and this also had a negative contribution. This could be explained by the fact that the reason for the credit might be uncommon or unexpected which by default increases the risk in the perception of the bank. Finally, the age of the customer was 23 and also reduced the probability of being a safe credit. Younger people tend to have less savings and financial stability. To conclude, all factors had a negative contribution which is why the model decided that a bad credit risk is likely.", "The model predicted with good certainty that the customer will be a good credit risk and that problems are unlikely. Interestingly, the most important feature suggested otherwise and had a negative contribution towards good credit risk. This was the fact that the customer had no checking account. This could indicate poor financial literacy or interest in financial aspects by the customer. However, this is somewhat counteracted by the next feature which has a positive contribution and shows that the customer has a good amount of savings on their savings account. The next feature also contributed positively which was the below average requested credit amount. Naturally, the exposure of a bank becomes less for smaller sums of money. Finally, the fact that the customer was not living in a rented property had a negative contribution. By itself this effect is not very clear, but it is possible that not renting might be correlated with having a mortgage running. To summarize,  aside from the slightly larger credit amount and the absence of a checking account the model did not receive sufficient negative indications to label the customer a bad credit risk. ", "The model predicted with great certainty that the customer is going to be a good credit risk and the bank is likely not to experience any problems with them. There is not a single feature that could suggest any risk and the story is a clear one. First of all the purpose of the feature is to get a new car. It seems that historically car loans have been reliable because perhaps they could be correlated with professional reasons or for family reasons, indicating some degree of maturity and stability. Next, the amount of requested credit is below average which reduces the exposure of the bank. The age of the customer is 36 and slightly above average, and this could indicate a greater degree of financial stability relative to younger people. Finally, the customer has a  history of credits that have all been repaid on time and without any troubles, indicating to the bank that they are trustworthy. In conclusion, there are no signs pointing towards any significant risk and the model predicts a safe and good credit. ", "The model predicted with quite good certainty that the customer is unlikely to be a good credit score and there might be some risks associated with providing them with credit. The decision is easily understood if we note that all of the most important features contributed in a negative way towards being a good and reliable credit. First, the customer had no checking account which had a strong negative contribution. The absence of a checking account could indicate an absence of financial literacy or insufficient flowing funds to require one. An equally negative contribution came from the loan duration, which was four years, while the average lies below two years. In risk assessment, duration is always a crucial element as longer durations allow for more unexpected and unaccounted factors to emerge. The amount of credit requested was also above average, which naturally involves more exposure for the bank. Finally, the customer had no savings account, again indicating either the absence of good financial habits or savings altogether. To summarize, all features were pointing towards some degree of risk for the bank which explains the prediction of the model.

The most significant negative factor that contributed to this decision was the fact that the student failed a class in the past, and this could be indicative of future performance. Next, the student had no ambition to get a higher education after high school. This could suggest an absence of motivation or academic talent, which does not help with passing the year. The student also goes out with friends really often. This could detract attention from their studies and in light of the other features suggest a careless attitude towards the studies. Finally, the age of the student was above average for that year, and this could mean that the student already had to do over a year in the past or had some other problems in the past. To summarize, the story is quite clear, there are indications of past poor performance, absence of academic motivation and perhaps a careless attitude, which explains the model's prediction.", "The model predicted that the student will likely pass at the end of the year, although only by a small margin. The story is quite interesting where all the most important features detract from the probability of passing, yet the final probability still remains above 50%. The most important negative contribution is the fact that the student has a history of one previous class failure, since past failures could indicate problems in the future. Next, the student reports to have very little free time, which has also a negative contribution and could indicate either a very busy schedule with many other responsibilities or simply that the student is not getting enough relaxation. The next negative feature and that is the fact that the student is receiving extra educational support. This is quite peculiar that receiving support reduces your probability, but it could be explained by noting that usually only students that already have problems with their grades for other reasons will request support. There are also one positive factor, and that is that the student doesn't go out often, which is generally not conducive to good academic performance. To summarize, there are indications of past academic problems with past failures and requested educational support, but at the same time some positive factors like not going out play a positive role. Overall the negative factors were not strong enough to suggest that the student will fail. ", "The model predicted that the student would pass at the end of the year with good certainty. The most important contribution to this positive prediction was the fact that the number of past class failures was zero which suggests a good student and is predictive of future performance. The student also rarely goes out which also has quite a positive contribution because going out too often generally is bad for focus and rest which are necessary for a good school performance. The number of school absences is also quite below average, providing another suggestion for a good focus and motivation. One minor negative factor is the fact that the mother's occupation of the student does not fall in the common occupations and lies in the \"others\" category, which could suggest a less certain financial stability of the family. To summarize almost all of the important features point towards good performance and paint a picture of a student that has no failures, barely any absences and good focus on their school work. This explains the model's good certainty to predict the student passing this year. ", "The model predicted that the student would pass at the end of the year with good certainty. The most important factor in the decision was the high frequency of going out of the student and  had a negative contribution against the eventual decision. While going out a little can create a social life and provide good work-life balance, going out too often, which is the case for this student, is likely to reduce focus and negatively affect their school results. The next feature on the other hand has a positive contribution with the student not having failed any class in the past and in academic performance past performance is often indicative of the future. In a very surprising result, the fact that the weekend alcohol consumption is very low had a slightly negative contribution. If we may speculate, with a high frequency of going out, a low weekend alcohol consumption could perhaps suggest a higher consumption during the week. However, the contribution is so minor that it could also fall within the uncertainty of this method. The last feature has a positive contribution, and this is the fact that the mother has a common occupation that does not fall in the \"others\" category. This could be indicative of financial stability at home which is of course conducive to good performance of the student. To summarize, the picture painted is not conclusive, and there are both positive and negative factors largely canceling one another. With the baseline probability for passing already being quite high, these mixed factors did not weigh sufficiently in any direction to change the prediction.", "The model predicted that the student is unlikely to pass, and if we look at the features we find that all of them had a negative contribution towards the probability of passing. First of all, the by far most dominant feature fas the number of past failures -- which was at three, while the average value is far below one. This suggests a student that has already been struggling for a while, and could be a good indicator for future performance. The next negative factor, although less important that the failures, was the fact the student has no ambition to get higher education after high school. The absence of motivation or ambition to show a good school performance is likely to result in less studying. The student is also more than a year older than what is typical for this year, which means that there were some problems in the past such as for example having to do over a year. Finally the student goes out at a massive frequency, far above average, which is likely to have a very negative effect on their focus and energy levels. In conclusion, all factors point towards a student that has been struggling for a while already, and that is not able to find motivation to improve their performance. This explains the prediction of the model that the student is likely to fail. ", "The model predicted with good certainty that this student will pass at the end of the year. The most important observation towards this decision was the fact that the student goes out much less than the typical student from that age group. This could suggest being more motivated or focused on their studies and generally should contribute to school performance. The student also has not failed a class before, which also contributed positively towards the prediction, as the past can point towards future performance in an academic setting. In addition, the student had a good attendance with only two absences, which eliminates the scenario of an unmotivated student that doesn't come to class and points to some degree of motivation and consistency. The only factor that had a negative contribution was the fact that the reason for choosing this school was for the course offer. However, this contribution was far smaller and could have been due to historic trends in the data that we cannot know just based on the table. To conclude, aside from this small negative point, all factors point towards a student with a history of great academic performance, good attendance and good motivation.

Secondly, the student seems to not go out with friends that much, which also contributes positively to the prediction. This might show that he or she is dedicated to their studies. The third positive factor is gender. In combination with the other features, the individual's gender point to him/her being more likely to pass the course.\nLastly, the student is also less absent from school than on average. Being present in class more is usually a positive factor for someones studies.\nTo summarize, both the profile of the student (gender and how much time he/she goes out) and their behavior in class (past failure and absences) point to the prediction that the student will likely pass the course.", "The model predicted that the student will likely pass the course.\nThe most important feature is 'Higher', which contributes negatively to the prediction score. The student does not want to get higher education, which can be a sign of a worse academic performance. The second most important feature 'Failures' contributes positively to the prediction score.

The student goes out moderately, but less than average, which also contributes positively to the prediction score.\nLastly, the student is a bit younger than average, which is also a positive factor. This might seem a bit counterintuitive, as more mature students can also do better in school, but it might also point to the fact that he skipped a grade and is thus very efficient in school.\nTo summarize, despite the student not having higher education aspirations, their other traits such as their age, going  out behavior and past failure rate point to the student being likely to pass the course.", "The model predicts the student as likely to pass the class. The first feature contributing positively to this prediction is 'failures'. The student has never failed the class before, which makes it unlikely that they will fail now. The second feature, which relates to the job of the mother being a teacher, contributes negatively to the prediction. This makes less sense, as it seems that having a teacher as a mother would rather help to pass the class, and not be a negative factor. Thirdly, the student is absent a bit more than on average, which is also a positive factor in the prediction. This is also not a very logical pattern.\nThe last factor, daily alcohol consumption, contributes negatively to the prediction. The student does not consume that much alcohol, but a bit more than his peers, which contributes negatively to  his prediction scores. \nTo summarize, the student is predicted to pass the course, likely due to their past failure rate being very low, as most of the other features contribute negatively to the prediction score.", "The model predicted that the student would pass with a reasonably strong confidence. The highest contribution to this was their 0 failures. A student with no prior failures is less likely to fail a future class. The third most impactful feature was the lack of family education support, with another positive contribution. Students that don't receive education support are likely those that need it less, and thus more likely to perform well. Additionally, the fourth most impactful feature is age, where there age, 16, is just below the average and positively contributes towards the prediction. This is likely because a young age suggests a high achieving student that has been brought forwards where as an older age suggests a poor performing student that has been held back. The second most impactful feature was their reason to study at the school which was based on the choice of course. This strangely was a negative contribution, it is possible that students that choose school based on choice may be trying to game the system to find easier courses. In summary, the student was predicted to pass because of their lack of previous failures, lack of educational support and young age, despite their reason to choose the school.", "The model is quite confident about the fact that the student will succeed.

Normally, a high number of school absences is something that has a negative influence. For this student, the number is way above average. The job of the mother does not fall in the category 'other' and that is always something good.

This category represents the more unusual jobs and it is often better that the mothers job is an ordinary job. The family also doesn't get any educational support. Educational support is often given to people that need it because of a more vulnerable situation. The fact that the student has a stable home situation and no history of failure, makes the model predict that he will pass. ", "The model predicts that the student will pass. In the past, he only failed one time. This is certainly not as good as a history of only successes but there are other factors that have also an important influence. First of all, the student was never absent. This is a very good sign because it shows consistency in effort and motivation. The weekly study time is also above average. The student has chosen the school because of its good reputation. This shows that he has put some effort in collecting information about the different schools. As a conclusion we can say that the good attitude of never being absent combined with an above average amount of study time, made the model predict that this person will pass.

The model assumes that since this student has not failed a class before, they will not fail a class this year. Another feature that contributes a lot to the prediction for this student is studytime. This student has a relatively high study time of 5 to 10 hours per week. The student had a below average number of school absences and a below average like for going out with friends. These factors also positively contribute to the prediction of the model for this student to pass.

These factors lead to the model predicting the person to be a good student and to pass at the end of the year.", "The model predicts that the student will very likely pass their final year. The largest contributors for this decision is the fact that the father of the student has a higher education degree and that the student has a below average number of going out with friends. They also did not have any absences throughout the year and have not failed a class before. Both of those features are well below average for this student compared to other students. Based on that information, the model predicts that the student is very likely to pass their final year as their father has a higher education degree and the student seems to be very diligent.", "The model predicted with great certainty that the student will pass at the end of the year. All features contributed in a positive way towards the probability of a passing grade, so let us briefly go through them. The most important contribution came from the two number of absences which was well below average and suggest consistency and dedication. Next, the student had zero failures in the past. The fact that the student was strong in the past indicates that this performance is likely to continue unless some factors are pointing against this. The fact that the student was male also had a positive contribution suggesting that males were more likely to pass at this school in the past. Gender biases are known to exist in academia for various societal reasons, and were even stronger in the past which could explain this contribution. Finally, the student went out not too often, slightly below the average, which also means that they are not likely to get distracted from their studies. In conclusion, all feature have a positive contribution and explain the decision of the model.", "The model predicted that the student is not likely to pass at the end of the year, but still only by a small margin and the features present a mixed story. First of all, the by far most important feature that reduced the probability of passing was the fact that the student had 2 failures in the past -- well above average. The fact that the student had difficulties in the past suggests that this might continue to this year unless some significant changes are made. All other features besides this one, had a far smaller effect overall and had mixed positive and negative contributions and let us go through them. The fact that the student did not attend nursery school had a positive contribution. Nursery school is likely more practically oriented and is unlikely to contribute positively towards more general courses like math in high school, and in fact could only reduce the remaining time for their studies. Next, the mother of the student had an uncommon job and fell in the \"other\" category and this had a negative contribution towards passing. Having an uncommon job could possibly indicate less financial stability on average. Finally, the student was more than a year younger than average, which had a small positive contribution. This could perhaps mean that the student skipped a year when they were younger due to some academic talent. To conclude, the decision towards not passing was almost solely made because of past failures of the student. Other features presented a mixed picture of both positive and negative aspects, that largely neutralized one another and had no dominant effect. ", "The model predicted that the student is likely to pass. Looking at the feature analysis, we can see that not one single feature had a completely dominant contribution and the decision was made after weighing multiple aspects. First of all, interestingly, the most important feature had a contribution that detracted from the probability of passing. This was the fact that the mother of the student has an uncommon type of job, which on average could suggest less financial stability in comparison to the more typical occupations. However, all other features besides this one had positive contributions. The number of failures in the past was zero suggesting a good and dedicated student. The frequency of going out was also below average, which eliminates the possibility of the student getting too distracted by going out. Finally, the student being male also had a small but positive contribution towards passing. It is well known that gender biases are present in all types of training data for various societal reasons and this could also be the case here. In conclusion, aside from the small negative contribution from the uncommon parental occupation, all other features were pointing towards a passing grade which explains the prediction of the model.", "The model predicted that the student will pass at the end of the year with good confidence, and we can see that almost all feature contribute positively towards passing. First, the frequency of going out is very low. Since many students start going out at this age, and this can have distracting consequences, not going out eliminates this potential pitfall and has a positive contribution to the passing probability. Next, the fact that the student was male contributed positively as well. While sex or gender by itself should not directly contribute to academic performance, there could be historical biases present at this high school or region as to why males had a better performance in the training data.  The student also had no past failures, which of course contributed positively as past performance could be indicative of future in these cases. Finally, the only feature that contributed negatively was the fact that the mother was a teacher. This is really surprising as one would expect that the mother would then be more involved in their child's studies. As a possible but more speculative interpretation we could imagine that a strong involvement of the parent in the child's studies could in fact have the opposite effect.  ", "The model predicted that the student is likely to pass  at the end of the year. Looking at the features we can see that none of the features had a really strong contribution, and the prediction was a result after weighing many counteracting factors. The first and most negative contribution towards passing came from the very high frequency of going out by the student. Going out too frequently might involve alcohol and bad rest, which of course affect student performance. Indeed, as we will come back to in a moment, the student had many absences that could be related to this. On a positive note, the student had no past failures, which fully neutralized the negative effects from the previous feature. When it comes to qualities such as responsibility and study habits, past performance could be a strong indicator of future performance. The next feature that had a positive contribution was the fact that the student was not receiving educational support from their family. While this being positive might be surprising at first, it falls in line with the previous observation -- if the student never had any issues in the past, family support was not needed. The final feature, that we mentioned before as well, was the large number of absences which had a negative contribution. Absences result in missing more study material and are to be expected to contribute in a negative way. To summarize, the student appears to demonstrate both negative aspects that indicate a lack of motivation and focus, but at the same time exhibit a strong performance in the past which could indicate that the student can still do well even in light of absences.

The by far most significant contribution that detracted from the probability of winning is the fact that the team scored zero goals. This is to be expected as the man of the match is typically awarded for crucial and game deciding plays such as scoring or creating scoring opportunities. The absence of goals eliminates any such scenario and makes winning unlikely. There were also a few much more minor factors that we could mention. The team had a an above average ball possession which increased the probability of winning by a little bit since this could indicate a dominant play on the field. They also made a slightly above average number of attempts on the goal, indicating a good offensive with room for possibly impressive plays. The team committed a large number of fouls which had a minor negative contribution for getting the award because fouls could place a player in a negative light for the deciding committee. In conclusion, the team scored no goals which almost single handedly swayed the model to predict not getting the award. Other factors paint a mixed picture of good offense but with many fouls and were not able to change the decision by the model.", "The model predicted that the team is not likely to receive the man of the match award. There was no single dominant feature that fully swayed the model and the decision is a combination of numerous factors. The two most important factors were the number corners taken and the number of attempts on the goal, which both were below the average value for these matches and hence contributed negatively towards winning. Few attempts together with few corners strongly suggest the absence of an offensive play style. The team did score one goal, which had a minor positive contribution. Note that in these matches teams typically score more than one goal and hence this by itself is not remarkable enough to have a strong effect. Finally, the distance covered was slightly above the average, but nevertheless reduced the probability of winning. In light of a weak offense, running a lot could does not necessarily makes a better impression and could even indicate a worse control of the game. To summarize, the picture painted here is one of a team that had a weak offense but still managed to get one goal in, which was not enough to convince the model that they will get the award.", "The model predicted that the team is unlikely to win the man of the match award. Surprisingly, the most important feature had a positive contribution and significantly raised the probability of winning the game, which was an impressive number of four goals scored by the team. Scoring goals is the easiest way to demonstrate impressive plays in which man of the match worthy performances could be found. However, aside of this major feature all of the other factors contributed negatively which collectively neutralized the effect of the goals. The team took zero corners, had a below average number of attempts on the goal, and covered a surprisingly small distance during the match. This paints the picture of a team that easily scored four goals without having to do much offensive effort and was perhaps paired against a far weaker opponent where players of the winning team were not able to show their skill. This could explain why the model decided that the team will not get the award. ", "The model predicted that the team is more likely not to win the man of the match award, but only by a very small margin and is hence not completely certain of its decision. The most important factor that contributed towards this decision were the very few number of corners in comparison to was is typically seen in these games. This negative contribution likely indicates that the number of time spent near the goal of the opponent, from which corners might arise, was limited. On the other hand, the team scored one goal which somewhat increased the probability for the award, but not by enough to offset the absence of corners. This might be surprising since scoring goals would be expected to be the most important factor, but one goal is clearly not sufficient to provide conclusive evidence. The next two factors were quite minor and contributed in opposite directions neutralizing each other. The team covered a distance that is around the average which was positive, but the number of free kicks was below the average further strengthening the idea of insufficient offensive play. To summarize, it seems that outside of the single goal there were no indications of impressive or strong play and many factors that would be typically correlated with a pressing play such as the corners and free kicks were subpar. This could explain the decision of the model that it is not very likely for the team to get the award. ", "The model predicted with great certainty that the team will not win the man of the match award. The by far most dominant factor that contributed to this decision was the absence of any goals scored. Scoring goals not only holds the highest potential for impressive plays, but also indicates that the team at best had a draw, and their players were rather unlikely to have a game-deciding contribution. The next two features were also negative but  far more minor and they explain why the team had no goals. The number of attempts on goal and the number of on-target shots both were below average, indicating that the team did not have many opportunities to score goals at all. One small positive point came from the large number of corners taken, which at least suggests that the team did spent some time attacking on the other half. To summarize, the team was not able to capitalize to get even a single goal in during the rare opportunities they created. ", "The model predicted that the team is not likely to win the man of the match award. If we look at the features, it is quite interesting because the feature that had the largest individual influence on the model's decision was pointing against the made decision and had a positive contribution to the probability of winning the award. This was the two goals scored which indicates at least two moments in the game where attacking players had the opportunity to stand out with impressive plays. However, this positive contribution was almost completely countered by the few number of corners that the team took, one while the average lies closer to five. Corners occur during intense game moments on the opposite side of the field, and their absence indicates that such moments were quite limited. The two next features are more minor but both contribute negatively. The number of attempts on the goal is below average, further confirming the absence of offensive plays aside from the two goals. The number of passes is also far below average. This could indicate that they were not sufficiently in control of the ball which makes sense in light of the previous observations. To summarize, the picture painted is that the team scored two goals by luck or misplays from the other team, with all other metrics pointing towards an unimpressive offensive game and outweighing the effects from these two goals. ", "The model predicted that the team was not going to win the Man of the Match award, given the value of the other features. The most important feature (Goals Scored) had a very positive contribution to the prediction. Two goals were scored by the team, which is also more than the average, so it makes sense that the model gives this a positive weight. However, almost all the other important features (Corners, Free Kicks, nSaves) have a negative weight, which can show that the match was less 'active' than might be expected.\nTo summarize, although the team scored more goals than the average, almost all the other features point to the team not being likely to win the Man of the Match Award.", "The team is predicted as not likely to win the Man of the Match award. The main reason for this prediction is that there were no goals scored by this team during the match, which contributed very negatively to the average prediction score. It also makes sense that if a team scores no goals during an entire match, they are unlikely to win this award. The features 'Corners' and 'Attempts' contribute positively to the prediction, which highlights that the team did try to make some goals, but unfortunately it did not work out. 'On-target' contributes negatively to the prediction: the team only had one shot on-target, which is a lot below the average. To summarize, based on these features, it seems unlikely that the team will win the man of the match award.", "The team is predicted as unlikely to win the Man of the Match award. The most important feature contributing to this prediction is 'Corners'. This feature has a very negative weight,  so the number of corner kicks taken by the team might be too low (when taking into account the other features).\nThe second most important feature is 'Goals scored'. The team scored more goals than usual which is a sign of a good match. However, the large negative weight of the feature 'Fouls Committee' suggest that the team committed a lot of fouls, which is behavior that is unlikely to get rewarded with an award. This is related to the fourth most important feature 'Yellow Card', which also has a negative weight and demonstrates that the team received a lot of yellow cards, which is also not the kind of play that is likely to be rewarded.\nTo summarize, the team did score a lot of goals but likely played not very 'sportslike' (shown by the features Fouls Committee and Yellow Card), which contributed to the negative prediction.", "The team is predicted to win the man of the match award. They scored two goals which had the largest positive contribution to winning the award. However, they made a lot of attempts on goal and also three corners, but these features had a negative influence on the prediction of winning the man of the match. Same thing can be said for the number of on-target shots, there are not a lot of on target shots and this influenced the prediction negatively. They did score two goals, but all the other features were below average which shows that they did not play very well or had a lot of opportunities. This team might be an underdog team and for them to score two goals might have been a very surprising outcome leading them for the model to predict them to win the man of the match award.", "The team was predicted not to win the man of the match award even though they scored a goal, which contributed positively to the prediction of the man of the match award. However, the combination of below average corners and below average attempts influenced the model's decision in a greater negative way to not award the man of the match award to this team. This team's distance covered was close to average which had a positive influence, however, this influence was too small to  counter the below average play. In summary, even though they scored a goal, the team's play was below average and not good enough for the model to predict the man of the match award.", "The team was predicted to win the man of the match award with reasonable confidence. A combination of factors led to this prediction. Most importantly were the two goals scored by the team which positively influenced the prediction, as the higher the number of goals, the more likely a team is to have won the man of the match award. Alongside this, the number of on target and total attempts positively influenced the decision, this could be because they correlated with the numbers of goals scored. However, the team had 13 total shots with 7 being on target, showing a clinic attack (or possibly failing opposition defense) which could in combination influence the decision strongly. Furthermore the 6 corners taken by the team in question positively influenced the prediction, as a corner generally implies attacking in the oppositions final third, a strong factor towards the number of goals scored.", "The team was predicted to not win the man of the match with a low confidence. The most important factors to this decision was the single goal scored, contributing positively towards the prediction. Although this may seem low, the larger the number of goals the greatest the chance of winning.\nThe second most important feature was corners taken, with only two. This suggests a limited amount of involvement in the final third of the oppositions half, and thus low attacking threat, explaining the negative contributions.\nTwo more negatively contributing features were attempts and on target shots with 6 and 1 respectively, both far below the feature average for the dataset. This low number of attempts and on target shots decreases the likelihood of a high scoring game. Additionally having only a single shot on target could be symptomatic of a sub bar attack, meaning they are less likely to win man of the match.", "The model predicted that the team would win the man of the match award with a high confidence. The most important factor to this decision was the positive impact of the two goals scored, as more goals scored means a higher chance of winning. This could also be in combination with the positive contribution from the sixteen attempts at goal, which was the third most important feature. This could suggest that the oppositions goal keeper was having an excellent game, or that the team was simply unlucky not to score more from their attempts. The second most important feature was the positive contribution from the close to 700 passes completed by the team. This large number of passes suggests dominance on the ball and means the teams players likely had a lot of it, and so more time to complete man of the match deserving actions. The fourth most important features was the positive contributions from the 8 corners. This is almost twice the average number of corners, and in combination with the high number of passes and attempts suggests a lot of the teams play happened whilst attacking in the oppositions final third.", "The model predicts that the team will not win the man of the match award. The most important reason for this is the fact that no goals were made. This is often a very important factor for the decision on the man of the match award. The team made an above average number of passes, which would lead to a positive contribution. A significant fraction of these passes were successful. However, this above average amount of passes with good accuracy did not result in winning the match. The passes were probably made during less important parts of the match. Another important  factor is the fact that quite some shots were blocked by the opponent. As a conclusion we can say that the active game with a lot of good passes did not result in any goals and therefore the model did not predict that the team will win the award.

A performing goalkeeper is always good but you also need to score. On this criterion, the team also performed above average. The team covered a distance that was below average during the match. However, this did not influence the result in a negative way. A slightly above average number of attempts on goal were made. The most important thing is that the attempts were quite successful.

Indeed, the first feature had a strong positive contribution towards the probability of winning, was that the team scored two goals. This is quite reasonable, scoring goals is the most important action in the game and is likely to put the scoring players in a good spotlight for the award. However, the next three features had all a negative contribution and together counteracted this first positive aspect. The number of corners taken was below average and might indicate that, aside from the goals,  the pressure on the other half of the field could have been subpar. The distance covered by the team was also on the lower side which also had a negative contribution. This could indicate an absence of visible effort or create a more passive impression on the jury committee. Finally, the number of passes was high and above average, but surprisingly had a negative contribution as well. A possible interpretation is that in absence of strong offensive pressure, a large number of passes could indicate a weaker control over the game. In conclusion, after weighing the strong positive contribution from the goals scored, and all the other more minor negative contributions, the latter weighed trough and swayed the model to predict not receiving the award.", "The model predicted that the team would receive the man of the match award with some certainty. If we look at the contributions of the various features we can see an interesting story. The first feature, which was the below average distance covered by the team, had a strong negative contribution towards the probability of getting the award. This is to be expected as putting in lower physical effort might is might be generally perceived as weaker play. However, the fact that the team scored two goals almost completely neutralized this negative aspect, as scoring goals are generally game-deciding moments for which players can get the award. The next two features had a smaller, but still positive contribution swaying the model towards a positive evaluation. These were the above average corners taken and above average attempted shots on the goal. Both indicate a strong presence on the other half, and bold offensive play is generally regarded highly in football. Therefore, the picture painted is that of a team that had an excellent attacking style, which allowed them to score two goals, without even having to make notable physical efforts. This explains why it was predicted to receive the award. ", "The model predicted that the team is unlikely to receive the man of the match award. This decision was mainly formed  by the two most important features contributing in a negative way towards the award. The number of shots on target was really high and far above average, but instead of resulting in numerous goals this resulted in a large amount of blocked shots. Therefore, the first and most negative feature was blocked shots, followed by a large number of attempts. This combination of features could likely suggest that these attempts were not convincing and the opponents' goalkeeper had no trouble saving them. There were also positive aspects though. The number of corners taken was also high, and indicates that the team created dangerous attacks in which the opponents were forced to concede corners. In addition, the team scored one goal, which is not high in light of the many attempts taken, but is still likely to be perceived as a positive aspect with goals being the most important action in the sport.
